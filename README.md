1) Information about the Project:
Title: House Price Prediction using Stacking and Model Combination
Objective: The project aimed to predict the price of houses based on various features, such as the number of rooms, bungalow area, and other relevant aspects. Stacking and model combination techniques were applied to enhance prediction accuracy significantly over base models.
Dataset: Collected and utilized a comprehensive dataset containing information on house features and their corresponding prices.

2) What I Did in the Project:
- Data Preprocessing: Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling. Ensured the dataset was ready for model training and testing.
- Stacking and Model Combination: Employed stacking, an ensemble learning technique, to combine predictions from multiple base models. Used diverse algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines to create the base models.
- Performance Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the stacking model and individual base models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize the overall accuracy of the stacked model.

3) Outcome of the Project (Increase in Accuracy):
- The stacking and model combination approach resulted in a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to individual base models. The stacking technique increased the accuracy by approximately 20% over the base models.
- The stacked model exhibited better generalization ability, reducing overfitting and making more robust predictions on new, unseen data.
- The project demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble learning methods in enhancing predictive accuracy, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications like house price prediction.
